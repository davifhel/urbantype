# UrbanType: A Typography Experiment

### Project Overview:
UrbanGlyphs is a creative text editor that transforms typographic elements from Munich's public spaces 
into dynamic, rule-based designs. By isolating letters from public signage and manipulating their forms, 
this project reimagines the often standardized and monotonous nature of urban typography. 
The goal is to give these letters a new aesthetic dimension through generative processes and user-defined rules.

The result is an interactive tool that allows users to explore, manipulate, and create unique typographic compositions.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Processing installed on your computer. 
Processing is an open-source creative coding environment that supports Java-based scripting for visual arts projects.

### Running the Script
1. Launch Processing on your computer.
2. Open the UrbanGlyphs.pde file (or the main .pde file if the project is split into multiple files).
3. Make sure all required assets (e.g., letter images) are located in the data/ folder within the project directory.
4. Click the Run button (the play icon) in Processing to start the script.
5. Interact with the tool using the provided controls to manipulate and arrange letters on the canvas.
6. Press ENTER to save an Image of your creation to the project folder.
